a key with 3 stop points, one normal click, a click with enough force that surpasses the first stop-point and then your met with another stop point the which is the
third button and again you need enough pressure to surpass the 2nd stop point to access this
--I FUCKING GOT IT[[[the user press the w but the w does register!!! but if the user presss hard enough and bypasses the stop point it deletes that w specifically and then continues with watever the second button does]]
just make sure nothing is selected while this is being done cuz u dont want to delete users files and shit.
